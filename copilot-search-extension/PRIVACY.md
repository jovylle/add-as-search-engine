# Privacy Policy — Add Copilot as search engine

Effective date: October 14, 2025

TL;DR: This extension is privacy-first. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. It only adds Microsoft Copilot as a search engine in Chrome.

## 1. Information We Collect
None. The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, browsing data, or search queries.

## 2. How the Extension Works
- Adds Microsoft Copilot as a search engine option in Chrome
- Enables the `copilot` keyword for quick access
- Redirects your query to `https://copilot.microsoft.com/?q={searchTerms}`

The extension runs locally in your browser and communicates only with Microsoft Copilot when you choose to search.

## 3. Data Sharing
We do not collect data; therefore, we do not share data. When you search using this extension, your query goes directly to Microsoft services, subject to their policies.

## 4. Permissions
This extension requests only the `search` permission, which is required to register a search engine. No other permissions are used.

## 5. Third‑Party Services
- Microsoft Copilot: https://privacy.microsoft.com/

## 6. Changes to This Policy
If this policy changes, we’ll update the effective date. Given the extension’s minimal scope, changes are unlikely.
